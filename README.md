# Heroes of the Shrine

In Heroes of the Shrine, players take on the role of Angel, a brave and cunning hero on a mission to explore the treacherous caves that are home to a horde of vicious goblins. Led by their formidable leader, the Possessor, these creatures will stop at nothing to defend their territory and prevent Angel from uncovering the secrets hidden within the cave. 

As players navigate the winding tunnels and overcome obstacles and enemies, they will uncover clues and uncover the mystery behind the Possessor and his army of goblins. With fast-paced action and challenging gameplay, this game is sure to keep players on the edge of their seats as they fight their way through the cave and face off against the Possessor in a final showdown.

Issues should be marked with the available labels, to categorize them and help filtering. When an issue is done, we close it and preferrably provide a comment with the reason for closing.
